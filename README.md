# An-eco-epidemiology-model-with-incubation-delay-for-predators-in-the-Lotka-Volterra-Models
This contains a paper that my colleagues and I wrote in Y4, which will be submitted for grading. And the codes to describe the relationship between the prey, healthy and ill predators. Solving this ODE model with a delay function and the Allee Effect is the shining point.
